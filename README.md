# Digital Certification Over Blockchain

An Decentralised Autonomous Organisation build using Solidity for Smart Contracts and Flutter for the front-end for creating and verifying certificates with the feature to vote in new issuers of certificates. The smart contract can be deployed on any EVM based chain.
#
## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:AlphaArtrem/dcob.git
```
2. Install truffle
```
cd contracts
npm install -g truffle
```
3. Install node dependencies
```
npm install
```
4. Compile the smart contract
```
truffle compile
```  
5. Create a new file ```.secret``` in same directory and add your 12 words mnemonic in the file.
```
touch .secret
```
6. Open the file ```truffle-config.js``` and change the ```deployment``` network settings with the desired chain configurations and then deploy the contract.
```
truffle migrate â€“-network deployment
```
7. Save the ```contract address``` after deployment.

```
8. Install and setup flutter <a href = "https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install">using the docs here</a>.
9. In the asset's folder rename the ```env_dummy.json``` file to ```env.json``` and the fill all the required JSON data.
```
{
    "ipfsInfuraApiKey" : "ipfsInfuraApiKey",
    "ipfsInfuraApiSecretKey" : "ipfsInfuraApiSecretKey",
    "contractAddress" : "contractAddress",
    "rpcUrl" : "rpcUrl"
}
```
You can get the Infura key and secret from <a href = "https://www.infura.io/">infura.io</a>. The contract address will be provide in the ```step 7```. RPC URL will be your chain's rpc url.

10. Fetch pub dependencies for Flutter and run the app.
```
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
